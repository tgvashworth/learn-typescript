# My meddlings with Typescript

I've been messing around with typescript. Here are my experiments. They're messy :)

## Getting started

To install TypeScript:

```sh
npm install -g typescript
```

## Compiling

```sh
tsc file.ts
```

Adding `-e` executes it too.

## Compiling for the browser

You gotta do things slightly differently for the browser:

```sh
tsc file.ts --module amd
```

And then add [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) to your page so that `require(...)` works.

Take a look at `web/` to see an example.
